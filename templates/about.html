<h1 class="text-center mb-4 fw-bold text-success">Welcome to ImageIguana!</h1>

<div class="p-4 rounded shadow theme-box">
    <p>Have you ever taken a photo and thought, <em>"Wow, this is great... but it could be greater if only it were a JPEG instead of a PNG!"</em>? Or perhaps you woke up one morning and realized, <em>"My life will be complete if I can just make this photo grayscale."</em> Well, friend, youâ€™re not alone â€“ and youâ€™re in the right place.</p>

    <p>At ImageIguana, weâ€™ve taken all the best parts of image editing and put them in one place, with one mission: <strong>to make sure your images become the best version of themselves</strong> (or at least convert to a different file type without too much drama). Why the name "ImageIguana"? Because like an iguana changing colors, your images deserve a little transformation too â€“ minus the scales. ðŸ¦Žâœ¨</p>

    <p>Weâ€™re a quirky group of developers, coffee addicts, and professional image wrestlers who believe that online image editing should be quick, easy, and fun â€“ and maybe even something you can tell your friends about. <em>"Oh, I just edited my images online using ImageIguana. No big deal."</em> You're welcome in advance for the bragging rights.</p>

    <p>So go ahead, give it a try. Whether you need your image to become a majestic grayscale masterpiece or just want to see what it would look like in WEBP format for... reasons, weâ€™ve got your back.</p>
