<h1 class="text-center mb-4 fw-bold text-success">How to Use ImageIguana</h1>

<div class="p-4 rounded shadow theme-box">
    <ol class="ps-3">
        <li class="mb-3"><strong>Upload Your Image 🖼️:</strong>
            <p>Click that shiny "Upload" button, select your image, and get ready to watch magic happen. Or mild changes. Either way, you're in for a good time.</p>
        </li>
        <li class="mb-3"><strong>Select Your Transformation 🌀:</strong>
            <p>Do you want your image to be <em>grayscale</em> because you’re feeling artsy? Or maybe you want it in <em>WEBP format</em> because you like living on the edge of technology? Choose wisely, or randomly – we’re not judging.</p>
        </li>
        <li class="mb-3"><strong>Click Submit Like You Mean It 🖱️:</strong>
            <p>This is the big moment! Click "Submit" and let ImageIguana do the heavy lifting (but let's be honest, it's just a file conversion – we’re not curing world hunger here).</p>
        </li>
        <li class="mb-3"><strong>Marvel at Your Masterpiece 🖌️:</strong>
            <p>You did it. You uploaded, you selected, you submitted. Now admire your converted image like it's a museum-worthy piece of art. Call your mom and tell her you're a digital artist now.</p>
        </li>
    </ol>

    <h2 class="mt-4 text-success">FAQs (Frequently Asked Quips)</h2>
    <p><strong>Q: What if I upload a bad photo?</strong><br>
        A: ImageIguana will still work, but it might judge you a little. Don’t worry, it’s an iguana, its standards aren’t high.</p>
    <p><strong>Q: Why did my photo turn into a gray rectangle?</strong><br>
        A: Ah, you chose "Convert to Grayscale." Artistic move. Or did you do it by accident? Either way, it's beautiful. Own it.</p>
